Face Detection with OpenCV
This project is a simple implementation of real-time face detection using OpenCV. It uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time through the webcam and displays them with bounding boxes. Additionally, the video feed is mirrored to simulate a natural "mirror" effect.

Features
Real-time face detection using your webcam.
Mirror effect on the video feed for a more intuitive user experience.
Uses Haar Cascade classifier pre-trained for face detection.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (opencv-python)
